Log_tee is a LOG shim server that writes client messages to
dedicated LOG sessions as well as a global component log. The
effect is that log messages are duplicated into two streams.

This component pays for each client session from its own quota,
client quota donations are forwarded to the LOG backends. This
is to prevent naive client donations from being depleted before
reaching the final logging destination.

Example: log messages should be written to the file-system,
the screen, and the kernel log.

  log_tee → terminal_log (on-screen)
     ⇊
  log_tee → parent (kernel)
     ⇊
   fs_log (file-system)
